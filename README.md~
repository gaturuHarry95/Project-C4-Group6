In this project, we are replicating an e-commerce website as provided on the provided Figma design.We have
carefully used semantic HTML tags to structure the content logically,applied CSS styling to accurately reproduce the design's visual components and
ultimately ensured that the design is responsive and adapts well to different screen sizes.

Through the project journey, we encountered challenges such as different approaches to styling techniques but all led to 
the desired design.We overcame this by agreeing to pick the most easiest, direct and the finest(one which consumed the least lines of code) way.
